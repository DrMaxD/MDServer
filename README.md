Minecraft Server hosted on Ubuntu desktop with custom datapack. 

## Summary

MDServer is a Minecraft server hosted on a Linux-based machine, specifically Ubuntu. The project involves setting up a Minecraft server using the official Minecraft server `.jar` file, running the server with specific memory allocations, and allowing players to connect through a local network. The server is easy to set up and provides the flexibility to host Minecraft worlds, configure server settings, and manage the server with basic Linux commands. Additionally I will be creating a custom datapack for the server to edit server in a few ways to make the gameplay  more enjoyable for users.
